Description
===========

Copy of opscode ohai cookbook, for specifically tweaking ipaddresses for vagrant nodes.

See https://github.com/agoddard/street-chef/commit/4c510cb49409b40594a530b16a9af61ca70a49c4

**NOTE**: This was forked from
[bryanwb/cookbooks-vagrant-ohai](https://github.com/bryanwb/cookbooks-vagrant-ohai)
to convert the plugin from Ohai 6 => 7. This will **not** work on Ohai <7.0.0
